# Chromebrew scripts (Method without git command)
Useful bash utility scripts for Chrome/Chromium OS systems.

## Overview
[Neverware](https://www.neverware.com/) disables the ability to perform a [powerwash](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084?hl=en) in [CloudReady](https://www.neverware.com/#getcloudready) and [Google](https://www.google.com/) disables execute permissions on certain directories to protect [Chromium OS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os). These scripts are useful to [powerwash](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084?hl=en) your [Chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) and reset to the factory settings, install, remove or update [Chromebrew](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew) or remove rootfs verification and mount your filesystem to be read/write.

## WARNING
If used improperly, these scripts can render your system useless. Please proceed with caution and do not execute unless you know what you're doing. Review the `References` section below to understand the impact of the changes. As true of any open source software, I'm not responsible if you brick your system.
